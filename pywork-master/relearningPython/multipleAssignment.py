# multiple assignment = allows us to assign multiple variable at the same time in one line of code

# name = "Gaurav"
# age = 13
# attractive = True

name, age, attractive = "Gaurav", 13, True

print(name)
print(age)
print(attractive)

# If all the variables are the same
# Spongebob = 30
# Patrick = 30
# Sandy = 30
# Squidward = 30

Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30

print(Spongebob)
print(Patrick)
print(Sandy)
print(Squidward)
